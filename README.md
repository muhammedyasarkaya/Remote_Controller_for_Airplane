# Remote_Controller_for_Airplane
Using Arduino, Joysticks and NRF24L01+PA, 
I'm developing a controller to transmit the control parameters to the receiver which is in model aircraft.

After finish coding for Tx, I'll start to write some lines for Rx part.
After that telemetery system will be created based on similar components and various sensors.
